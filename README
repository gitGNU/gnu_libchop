libchop
=======

This is libchop, a file hashing, ciphering, and indexing library.  This
library provides a framework which allows:

  1.  to cut a file into pieces, store each of these blocks into a block
      store, and then store sufficient information for later retrieval
      and rebuilding of the indexed file;

  2.  to restore (rebuild) a file based on an abstract index, reading
      blocks from one (or several) block stores.

This is particularly suitable for content-based indexing (as used by
many peer-to-peer file sharing systems, as well as several revision
control systems such as Monotone and Torvalds' GIT), and content-hash
ciphering (as used by anonymous file sharing systems such as GNUnet and
FreeNet).

libchop contains several implementations of the various operations
listed above (several block stores, several file cutting algorithm,
etc.).  It is meant to be as flexible as possible while still retaining
performance.

The best way to experiment with libchop is to try out the
`chop-archiver' sample utility program available in the `utils'
directory.


Requirements
------------

Libchop primarily targets the GNU system (i.e. GNU C compiler and GNU C
library), although porting it to other systems shouldn't be too hard
(especially with the help of Gnulib).

If building from scratch:

  Autoconf 2.59
  Automake 1.9

Optional (but highly recommended) build dependency:

  GNU Gperf

Mandatory dependencies:

  libcom_err
  GNU libgcrypt 1.2
  Sun/ONC RPC framework (part of the GNU C Library)

Optional dependencies:

  GNU GDBM
  libtdb
  SleepyCat's Berkeley DB (BDB) 4.4 (4.3 should work too)
  zlib
  libbz2
  liblzo2

  GnuTLS 1.4.1 (or compatible --- recommended)
  Avahi 0.6 or later

If you want to build the Guile bindings of libchop (you don't have to),
then you'll need the following:

  GNU Guile 1.8
  G-Wrap 1.9.7 or later

And that's it.
