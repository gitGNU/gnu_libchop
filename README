libchop
=======

This is libchop, a file hashing, ciphering, and indexing library.  This
library provides a framework which allows:

  1.  to cut a file into pieces, store each of these blocks into a block
      store, and then store sufficient information for later retrieval
      and rebuilding of the indexed file;

  2.  to restore (rebuild) a file based on an abstract index, reading
      blocks from one (or several) block stores.

This is particularly suitable for content-based indexing (as used by
many peer-to-peer file sharing systems, as well as several revision
control systems such as Monotone and Torvalds' GIT), and content-hash
ciphering (as used by anonymous file sharing systems such as GNUnet and
FreeNet).

libchop contains several implementations of the various operations
listed above (several block stores, several file cutting algorithm,
etc.).  It is meant to be as flexible as possible while still retaining
performance.

The best way to experiment with libchop is to try out the
`chop-archiver' sample utility program available in the `utils'
directory.

Note that libchop primarily targets the GNU system (i.e. GNU C compiler
and GNU C library).
