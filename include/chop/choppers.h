   deterministically find anchors within a file such that identical blocks
   among similar files may be discovered.  WINDOW_SIZE is the size of the
   sliding window used to compute fingerprints.  The paper recommends 50.
   Lower values may yield smaller blocks and better similarity detection.
   The probability of finding a block boundary, and therefore the average
   size of blocks, largely depends on the value of MAGIC_FPR_MASK, the mask
   that will be applied to each fingerprint computed in order to determine
   whether it should yield a block boundary.  The more bits are set in
   MAGIC_FPR_MASK, the less likely a fingerprint will match, and the larger
