Guile bindings for libchop
==========================

This directory contains the G-Wrap specifications used to generate Guile
(Scheme) bindings for libchop.  However, G-Wrap is constantly in flux,
so a few notes are necessary here.

First, the version that was originally used is G-Wrap 1.9.5 (and
1.9.6).  However, future versions introduce a slight architectural
change which has the unfortunate consequence of requiring each
specification module (the `*-spec.scm' files here) to add the following
line:

  #:use-modules (g-wrap c-codegen)

This is because the methods that are overloaded in these files (e.g.
`declarations-cg', `wrap-value-cg', etc.) are now exported by this
module.  In 1.9.[56], those were exported by `(g-wrap)', so one just
needs to comment out this `#:use-module' line to get things working with
1.9.[56].

This latest and greatest version we are talking about is available in at
least two GNU Arch archives [2]:

  rotty@debian.org--2005/g-wrap--dev--0 (starting from `patch-18')
  lcourtes@laas.fr--2004-libre/g-wrap--devo--1.9.6

Also, look at the archives of the `g-wrap-dev@nongnu.org' list for
merge requests I posted in Sept. 2005:
http://lists.nongnu.org/archive/html/g-wrap-dev/ .

Additionally, G-Wrap currently targets Guile 1.6, while we target 1.7
(in particular, we use SRFI-4 vectors and related C functions,
e.g. `scm_u8vector_elements ()').
