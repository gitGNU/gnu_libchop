Changes in 0.3 (since 0.2)

* New features

** New file system based block store

The `chop_fs_block_store' stores data blocks as a tree of files in the
user's file system, in a way similar to what Git does.  The main
advantage is its file system interface.  It makes it easy to rsync it to
a remote site, for instance, which can be useful when the remote site
cannot run `chop-block-server' or similar.

* Packaging

** GNU gperf is now required

** A C99 compiler is now required (instead of C89)
