Libchop is a library for distributed storage and data backup, available
under the terms of the [[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html][GNU General Public License]].  It was initially
designed as a building block for a [[http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00196822/en/][peer-to-peer, cooperative backup
system]].  In such a system, data has to be sent by pieces, incrementally,
and it may be scattered across several participating nodes.  In
addition, participating nodes may be untrusted, which puts data
confidentiality, integrity, and availability at risk.

In a nutshell, libchop addresses these issues by providing mechanisms
to:

  1. chop an input file into blocks, optionally compressed and/or
     encrypted, and to store them into a key-value store.  It returns
     an "abstract index" containing all the information necessary to
     retrieve the file.

  2. restore (rebuild) a file based on an abstract index, reading
     blocks from one (or several) stores.  Each block is decoded,
     deciphered, decompressed, and its integrity is checked according
     to the methods specified by the abstract index.

Libchop decomposes these task with a fine grain, providing generic
interfaces for each of the sub-tasks involved.  It also comes with
several implementations of each of these interfaces, allowing various
storage strategies to be quickly experimented and compared.
Implementations of these interfaces provide storage techniques such as
content-based addressing, content-hash keys, lossless compression, and
similarity detection.

Libchop was initially developed as part of the author's [[http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00196822/en/][PhD thesis]] in
the [[http://www.laas.fr/mosaic/][MoSAIC project]].

* Documentation

  - The (incomplete) reference manual is part of the source distribution
    in GNU Texinfo form.  It can also be [[./manual/libchop.html][browsed on-line]].

  - [[http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00187069/en/][/Storage Tradeoffs in a Collaborative Backup Service for Mobile
    Devices/]] presents the motivation behind libchop along with
    experimental results comparing several storage strategies.
