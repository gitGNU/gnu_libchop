Libchop is a library for distributed storage and data backup, available
under the terms of the [[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html][GNU General Public License]].  It was initially
designed as a building block for a [[http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00196822/en/][peer-to-peer, cooperative backup
system]].

Libchop features file hashing, ciphering, and indexing. In a nutshell,
it provides mechanisms to:

  1. cut a file into pieces, store each of these blocks into a block
     store, and return an "abstract index" containing all the
     information necessary to retrieve the file;

  2. restore (rebuild) a file based on an abstract index, reading
     blocks from one (or several) block stores and decoding them
     according to the methods specified by the abstract index.

Libchop decomposes these task with a fine grain, providing generic
interfaces for each of the sub-tasks involved.  It also comes with
several implementations of each of these interfaces, allowing various
storage strategies to be quickly experimented and compared.
Implementations of these interfaces provide storage techniques such as
content-based addressing, content-hash keys, lossless compression, and
similarity detection.

Libchop was initially developed as part of the author's [[http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00196822/en/][PhD thesis]] in
the [[http://www.laas.fr/mosaic/][MoSAIC project]].

* Releases

Releases are available from [[http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/libchop/][your nearest Savannah mirror]] (or from
[[http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases-noredirect/libchop/][Savannah itself]]).

* Documentation

  - The (incomplete) reference manual is part of the source distribution
    in GNU Texinfo form.  It can also be [[./manual/libchop.html][browsed on-line]].

  - [[http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00187069/en/][/Storage Tradeoffs in a Collaborative Backup Service for Mobile
    Devices/]] presents the motivation behind libchop along with
    experimental results comparing several storage strategies.

  - Chapter 4 of [[http://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00196822/en/][/Cooperative Data Backup for Mobile Devices/]] provides
    additional details and results, for the insatiable.

* Mailing List

A mailing list for bug reports and general discussion is available at
[[mailto:libchop-devel@nongnu.org][<libchop-devel@nongnu.org>]]. You can [[http://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/libchop-devel][subscribe]] to the mailing list and

* Development

Development occurs using the Git distributed revision control system.  A
copy of the source code repository can be obtained using the following
command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/libchop.git
#+END_SRC

The repository can be [[http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/libchop.git][browsed on-line]].
