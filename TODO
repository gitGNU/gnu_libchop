* Clean up the store iteration sub-interface.

* Write more documentation.

* Introduce copy constructors (grep the code for `FIXME' and `copy' to
  see why).

* Implement a DBus-based block store.

* Implement a BDB store (faster).

* Implement a bzip2 filter.

* Experiment with simple erasure codes, like B-Codes.  Not sure this belong
